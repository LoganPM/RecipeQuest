Project-Background:

Recipe Quest is a web application that allows users to find recipes by entering the ingredients they want to cook with first. Using the Spoontacular API users are given a wide variety of recipe ideas to choose from as well as a list of any ingredients they may be missing to complete the dish and start cooking.

The goal of this project was to make finding recipes easy and quick, to encourage users to cook at home more frequently and provide me with a challenging learning experience.
